Cookie Store!!

  Today I am showing cookie sales per hour for a days work for five different locations!

  For this assignment I was given different parameters such as location, minimum customers,
  maximum customers and average cookie sales to generate random numbers to show the cookie sales
  for each hour of a days work and the total for the day.

 This was so far the hardest assignment I feel we have had so far, I had trouble having each location
 loop through the same array that they randomly generated numbers were being stored. I ended up making
 a variable in a local scope for each function that would call on the cookiePerHour where the array is stored
 and put the store name in the parameters so it would call on that individual stores numbers to base the randomly generated
 numbers on.

 I also made a variable called sum that would add up all the sales per hour to give you your daily total,
 I made sum = 0 then added it to the cookie array.

 This assignment was definitely hard for me.
